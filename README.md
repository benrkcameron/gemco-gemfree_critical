# gemco-gemfree_critical
All k-vertex-critical (gem, co-gem)-free graphs for k=4 to k=16 (co-gem=P_4+P_1) 

The graphs are stored line-by-line in graph6 format for compact storage and easy reading. More about the format can be found here: https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.html

The first number in the file name indicates k. The Sagemath code used to generate these is available in the Jupyter notebook file vertex-critical_gem_co-gem_generator.ipynb
