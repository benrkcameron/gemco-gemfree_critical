# gemco-gemfree_critical
All k-vertex-critical (gem, co-gem)-free graphs for k=4,5,6,7 (gem=P_4+P_1)


The files contain all k-vertex-critical (gem, co-gem)-free graphs for k=4,5,6,7 (k=4 can be obtained from the 60 P4-vertex-critical P_6-free graphs found by Chudnovsky, Goedgebeur, Schaudt, and Zhong 2020 in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jctb.2019.04.006). 

The graphs are stored line-by-line in graph6 format for compact storage and easy reading. More about the format can be found here: https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.html

The first number in the file name indicates k and the last indicates the order of the graph.
